# Project 5: Capstone

This project is based on a Kaggle competition called “State Farm Distracted Driver
Detection” (https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection). Given a dataset of 2D dashboard camera images, I developed a ConvNet that is capable of classifying each driver's behavior, that is, if they are driving attentively or if they are distracted, for example, taking a selfie with their friends in the backseat.
